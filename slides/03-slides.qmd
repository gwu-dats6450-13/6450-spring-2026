## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Local** | Your current workstation (laptop, desktop, etc.), wherever you start the terminal/console application. |
| **Remote** | Any machine you connect to via ssh or other means. |

## Working on a single machine

You are most likely using traditional data analysis tools, which are **single threaded** and run on **a single machine**.

## The **BIG DATA** problem

<img src="img/moores.png">

## Is Moore's Law Dead?

---

## New Hardware 

### Need

* The demand for data processing will not be met by relying on the same technology. 
* The key to modern data processing is **new semiconductors**
  * Not just squeezing more transistors per area
  * Need new compute architectures that are built and optimized for specialized functions
* Specialized edge hardware for Edge Computing
* While many declare Moore’s Law to be broken or no longer valid, in reality it’s not the law that is broken but rather a heat problem.

### What

* Graphic Processing Units (GPUs)

* Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

* Data Processing Units (DPUs)

* Photonic computing

## So, we can't store or process data on a single machine, what do we do?

<img src="img/medium-6.png" width=800>


## We distribute

More CPUs, more memory, more storage!

<img src="img/distribute-the-data.png" width=600>

# How do we do that?


## Simple, we use the **cloud**

<img src="img/cloud-providers.png" width=800>

## Cloud computing is a big deal!

### Benefits

* Provides access to low-cost computing

* Costs are decreasing every year

* Elastic

* PAAS works!

* Many other benefits...

  * AI models need petabytes of training data
  * Cloud offers unlimited, globally distributed storage

* **Cost Efficiency**
  * Pay-per-use model for expensive AI hardware
  * No upfront investment in GPU clusters

## The Data Center Explosion {.smaller}

### The Numbers
- **2024**: Approximately **12,000 data centers worldwide** (not millions)
- **Power consumption**: Over **400 TWh annually** (about **1–1.3%** of global electricity use)
- **Growth rate**: **8–11% per year** (market CAGR), led by AI and cloud computing

### What's Inside Modern Data Centers?
- **Specialized AI Chips**: NVIDIA H100s, Google TPUs, custom silicon
- **Massive Scale**: Facebook (Meta) data centers operate **hundreds of thousands** of servers worldwide
- **Global Networks**: Hyperscale data centers leverage **sub-second** (near real-time) global data synchronization using high-speed optical networks

### Environmental Impact
- **Cloud leaders pledge carbon neutrality by 2030** (Google, Microsoft) or 2025 (AWS)
- Rapid **innovation in cooling** (liquid, AI optimization), **renewable energy adoption**, and **efficient chip design** is helping curb environmental impact

* **Transfer costs**: Still significant for large datasets
* **Edge computing**: Bringing compute closer to data sources

## The evolution of the Cloud

| Yesterday | Today | Tomorrow |
|---|---|---|
| Limited number of tools and vendors | Many tools and vendors to work with | Integrated tools and vendors |
| One platform - few devices | Multiple platforms - many devices | Connected platforms and devices |
| Data is scarce but manageable | Overabundance of data | Data is used for important business decisions |
| IT has major influence and control | IT has limited influence and control | IT is strategic to the business |
| People only work when they are at work | People work wherever they want | People have access to what they need, wherever they are |
